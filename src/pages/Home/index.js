As time goes on, preserved food loses its taste, but ingredients that are fresh with no preservatives provide the authentic taste that every single ingredient has.  'Cooking is an art and patience a virtue. Careful shopping, fresh ingredients and an unhurried approach are nearly all you need. There is one more thing - love. Love for food and love for those you invite to your table. With a combination of these things you can be an artist.' -Keith Floyd",
